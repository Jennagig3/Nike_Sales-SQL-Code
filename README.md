# Nike_Sales-SQL-Code

This project began by utlitizing Microsoft Excel to review the data of Nike sales for the years 2020 and 2021. I imported the dataset into Microsoft SQL and began thinking of questions pertaining to the data that I wanted answered with SQL queries. I used functions such as SUM for totaling the sales for U.S. States, Cities, months, years, and even by region and retailer. 

Since the format of the Invoice_Dates was 2020-01-01, and I wanted to show the months as their name instead of 1 and 2, I used DATENAME to have the month written out, such as January and February. 

Additionally, I'm always interested in visualizating the highest and lowest sales, therefore I used ORDER BY DESC for that specific query result.
